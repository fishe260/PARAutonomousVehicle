Succeeds: v2_2

Hardware: Arduino Due (32-bit)

Description: Arduino IO code for mechatronics, onboard sensors (excluding CV) & telemetry. 

v3.0:
-Widespread optimization and junk removal.
-Removed Compass (not as reliable as Gyro for heading calculation)
-Restored Mission Control
-Added IMU functionality
-Added Hall Effect sensor functionality (for current/voltage caluclation)
-Added confirmation for mode change
-Additional telemetry values sent (CPU Images per second, Acceleration)

v3.1
-Switched radio roles (used to be Kart slave/reading, MC master/writing. Flipped)
-Changed a lot of global variables to local / static variables (because that's faster)
-Better CPU Communication
-Seeding steering with absolute encoder values

v3.2
-Added brake functionality, reverse mode.
-RTK GPS Communication (Serial)
-CPU Communication (I2C)
