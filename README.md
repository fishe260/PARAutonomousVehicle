# PARAutonomousVehicle - The GitHub Repository for the Purdue Electric Vehicle Club - Autonomous Division!

NOTE: Purdue Electric Vehicle Club - Autonomous Division was also known as Purdue Autonomous Racing. 

We are Purdue Electric Vehicle Club - Autonomous Division! Our goal is to engineer an autonomous racing kart with the intention to win the Purdue Electric Racing Autonomous Vehicle competition. 

We intend to do complete this interdisciplinary project through three teams: the Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Team. The Mechanical Team's goal is to design the kart so that it has the ability to drive and steer at its maximum potential. The Electrical Team ensures that power is delivered to all subsystems of the kart; the team also ensures proper data communication is directed without interferences due to noise or hazards. The Software Team designs and implements algorithms relating to Computer Vision, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and Neural Networks. Each team lead collaborates with the others to ensure overlap is minimized and that the subsystems of the kart work properly when implemented. 

The team leads are as follows:

Project Lead: Tyler Mahlmamn.

Software Lead: Aidan Fisher.

Electrical Lead: Noah Pictor.

Mechanical Lead: Shao-Ting Huang. 

If you are interested in navigating our respository, please follow our guide as follows below. 

StereoVision: Holds the latest code relating to Object Detection (implemented via Stereo Vision). 
RoadFollower: Holds the latest code relating to curve tracking, which when implemented navigates the track while on the kart's first lap in order to map out the track using Stereo Vision Object Detection. 
I2C: Holds the latest code relating to communication with applicable kart subsystems using the I2C protocol.
